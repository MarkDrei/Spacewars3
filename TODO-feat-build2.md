- RESTful API endpoints: `/api/build-status`, `/api/build-item`, `/api/tech-catalog`

### **Phase 3: Frontend Implementation** âœ…
- Factory page with defense and weapon tables
- Real-time build queue with countdown timers
- Navigation integration between Game â†’ Factory â†’ Research
- Client-side factory service following established patterns
- Build functionality with proper iron validation

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY**

**Build system is fully functional:**
- âœ… 4 Defense items + 6 Weapon items with complete specifications
- âœ… Working build buttons with cost validation
- âœ… Real-time countdown timers and automatic completion
- âœ… Clean architecture following research page patterns
- âœ… All tests passing (264 tests across 29 test files)

## ðŸ“‹ **NEXT PHASE: Cheat Mode**

### **Phase 4: Developer Cheat Mode** âœ… (COMPLETE!)
- [x] Add cheat button to Factory UI after build queue section
- [x] Button only visible when there are builds in queue
- [x] Create `/api/complete-build` endpoint with username validation
- [x] Button completes first item in build queue instantly
- [x] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Update Factory page to refresh after cheat completion

**ðŸŽ® CHEAT MODE WORKING:**
- âœ… Server-side authorization (usernames "a" and "q" only)
- âœ… Instant completion of first queued build item
- âœ… Proper database updates (tech counts + queue removal)
- âœ… UI feedback with loading states and error handling
- âœ… Distinctive styling (orange button with lightning emoji)

**Evidence from Terminal:**
```
ðŸŽ® Cheat: Complete build requested by user: 1
ðŸ”“ Cheat mode authorized for developer: a
âš¡ Completing build: defense/ship_hull for user: 1
âœ… Cheat completed build: defense/ship_hull for user: a
```
