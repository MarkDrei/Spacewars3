# TODO: Transfer Build Feature from feat-build to feat-build2

## Overview
Transfer the build feature functionality from the old `feat-build` branch (monorepo structure) to the new `feat-build2` branch (Next.js structure), preserving all internal logic and tests.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Collection ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Analyze commits on feat-build branch
- [x] Identify 4 target commits with build feature changes
- [x] Collect all changed/new files
- [x] Create temporary copies of important changes
- [x] Document file mappings (old structure → new structure)

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Transfer backend logic (API routes, server-side code)
- [x] Adapt database schema changes
- [x] Implement build-related business logic
- [x] Transfer server-side tests

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (PENDING - UI design needed)
- [ ] Design UI/UX for build system
- [ ] Transfer frontend components and UI
- [ ] Adapt client-side services
- [ ] Transfer frontend tests
- [ ] Update type definitions

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Ensure all tests pass (223/223 ✅)
- [x] Verify build functionality works end-to-end
- [x] Fix any integration issues
- [x] Update documentation

## Phase 5: Cleanup (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Remove temporary files
- [ ] Final verification
- [ ] Update this TODO with completion status

## Backend Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Completed Components:**

#### 1. **Core Tech System**
- `src/lib/server/TechFactory.ts` - Tech catalog and damage calculations
- `src/lib/server/techRepo.ts` - Database operations for tech management
- `src/lib/server/migrations.ts` - Database migration system

#### 2. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added 11 new columns to users table for tech counts and build queue
- Migration system handles existing databases gracefully
- Default values: 5 for basic weapons/defenses, 0 for advanced items

#### 3. **API Routes**
- `/api/build-status` - Get current tech status and build queue
- `/api/build-item` - Start building weapons/defense items
- `/api/tech-catalog` - Get available items catalog

#### 4. **Tests**
- `src/__tests__/lib/TechFactory.test.ts` - 23 comprehensive tests
- All existing tests still pass (223/223)
- Build system fully tested and verified

### **Tech System Features:**

#### **Weapons Available:**
- **Basic**: Auto Turret (100 iron), Pulse Laser (150 iron)
- **Medium**: Gauss Rifle (500 iron), Plasma Lance (500 iron)  
- **Advanced**: Rocket Launcher (3500 iron), Photon Torpedo (2000 iron)

#### **Defense Available:**
- **Basic**: Kinetic Armor (200 iron), Energy Shield (200 iron)
- **Advanced**: Missile Jammer (350 iron)

#### **Build System:**
- Time-based construction queue (1-20 minutes per item)
- Iron cost deducted immediately when starting build
- Automatic completion processing
- Complex damage calculations with accuracy, shields, armor

### **Ready for Frontend Implementation:**
The backend is fully functional and tested. The system supports:
- Building items with iron costs
- Time-based build queues  
- Complex weapon vs defense calculations
- Full CRUD operations on tech items
- Automatic migration for existing databases

## Collected Changes (feat-build branch)

### Commits to Transfer:
1. **2628ac5** - feat: Implement TechFactory and TechRepo for managing ship technology and equipment
2. **54b5688** - added hull values and armor
3. **f2180d1** - made async method synchronous
4. **7c29f82** - refactor: Update database schema and queries to use users table for tech counts and build queue

### File Mappings (Old → New Structure):
- `packages/server/src/TechFactory.ts` → `src/lib/server/TechFactory.ts`
- `packages/server/src/techRepo.ts` → `src/lib/server/techRepo.ts`
- `packages/server/src/schema.ts` → `src/lib/server/schema.ts` (merge with existing)
- `packages/server/tests/TechFactory.test.ts` → `src/__tests__/lib/TechFactory.test.ts`

### Key Features Identified:
1. **Tech System**: Weapons and defense items with detailed specifications
2. **Build Queue**: Time-based construction system for items
3. **Database Schema**: Extended users table with tech counts and build queue
4. **Weapon Damage Calculations**: Complex damage system with accuracy, shields, armor
5. **Tech Repository**: Database operations for tech management

### Components Overview:

#### TechFactory.ts (417 lines)
- Weapon catalog (6 weapons): auto_turret, pulse_laser, gauss_rifle, plasma_lance, rocket_launcher, photon_torpedo
- Defense catalog (4 defenses): ship_hull, kinetic_armor, energy_shield, missile_jammer
- Complex damage calculation system with accuracy modifiers, ECM, shields/armor
- Cost and build duration management

#### techRepo.ts (382 lines)
- Database operations for tech counts
- Build queue management (JSON-based queue in users table)
- Transaction support for iron spending
- Automatic build completion processing

#### Schema Changes:
- Added tech count columns to users table (9 new columns)
- Added build_queue and build_start_sec columns
- Default values: 5 for basic weapons/defenses, 0 for advanced items

#### Tests (324+ lines):
- Comprehensive weapon damage calculation tests
- Accuracy modifier testing
- Shield/armor damage distribution
- ECM effectiveness testing
