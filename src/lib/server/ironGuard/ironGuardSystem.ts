 * IronGuard: Unbreakable Compile-Time Lock Protection System

 * Rules:
 * - Locks have numeric levels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 * - You can skip locks (1â†’3 is legal, or directly acquire 3)
 * - Once you hold a lock, you can only acquire higher level locks
 * - You can pass lock contexts to functions with compile-time validation
