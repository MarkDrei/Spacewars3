/**
 * IronGuard: Unbreakable Compile-Time Lock Protection System
 * 
 * Rules:
 * - Locks have numeric levels (10, 20, 30, 34, 35, 40)
 * - You can skip locks (10â†’30 is legal, or directly acquire 30)
 * - Once you hold a lock, you can only acquire higher level locks
 * - You can pass lock contexts to functions with compile-time validation
