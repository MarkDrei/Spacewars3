# Attack Integration Complete! ⚔️

## ✅ Canvas Click Attack System Implemented

### Summary
Players can now click on other player ships in the game to attack them, using the exact same interaction as collecting objects!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Click Behavior by Target Type

#### 1. **Clicking on Player Ships** 🚀
- **In Range (≤100 units)**: Initiates battle immediately
- **Out of Range (>100 units)**: Sets interception course to get closer

#### 2. **Clicking on Collectible Objects** 💎
- **In Range (≤125 units)**: Collects the object (asteroids, shipwrecks, escape pods)
- **Out of Range (>125 units)**: Sets interception course to get closer

#### 3. **Clicking on Empty Space** 🎯
- Sets ship direction toward clicked point

---

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. **`src/lib/client/services/attackService.ts`** (NEW)
- Service for calling the `/api/attack` endpoint
- Returns battle info on success
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. **`src/lib/client/game/SpaceObject.ts`**
- Added `getUserId()` method to get the userId from player ships
- Returns `undefined` for non-player objects

### 3. **`src/lib/client/game/Game.ts`**
- Updated click handler logic to distinguish between player ships and collectibles
- Added `handleAttack()` method (parallel to `handleCollection()`)
- Attack range: 100 units (same as attack API)
- Collection range: 125 units (existing)

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Range Checks
```typescript
// Player ships (attack range)
if (hoveredObject.getType() === 'player_ship') {
  if (distance <= 100) {
    this.handleAttack(hoveredObject);  // ⚔️ Initiate battle
  } else {
    this.handleInterception(hoveredObject);  // 🎯 Get closer
  }
}

// Collectible objects (collection range)
else if (distance <= 125) {
  this.handleCollection(hoveredObject);  // 💎 Collect
} else {
  this.handleInterception(hoveredObject);  // 🎯 Get closer
}
```

### Attack Flow
1. **Click on player ship** → Canvas detects click
2. **Check distance** → Calculate toroidal distance
3. **In range?**
   - ✅ Yes (≤100): Call `attackPlayer(userId)`
   - ❌ No (>100): Set interception course
4. **API call** → POST `/api/attack` with target userId
5. **Success** → Battle initiated, world refreshes
6. **Error** → Logged to console (can add UI feedback)

---

## 🎮 User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover**: Player ships show hover state (same as collectibles)
- **Click**: Immediate action (attack or interception)
- **Console**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Home Page**: Battle status appears with weapon cooldowns

### Expected Messages
```
⚔️ Attempting to attack player_ship with user ID 2
⚔️ Attack API response: { success: true, battle: {...} }
⚔️ Battle initiated! Battle ID: 1
⚔️ Attacker: 1 vs Attackee: 2
🔄 Triggering world data refresh...
```

## ⚠️ Validation & Error Handling

### Client-Side Checks
- ✅ Target must be a player ship (type === 'player_ship')
- ✅ Target must have valid userId
- ✅ Distance must be ≤100 units
- ✅ Network errors caught and logged

### Server-Side Checks (from API)
- ✅ Attacker must be authenticated
- ✅ Target user must exist
- ✅ Can't attack yourself
- ✅ Both users must have ships
- ✅ Neither user already in battle
- ✅ Attacker must have weapons
- ✅ Distance verified server-side

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Status
- ✅ **311/311 tests passing**
- ✅ **Build successful**
- ✅ **No breaking changes**

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the game (npm run dev)
2. Login with two users in different tabs/browsers
3. Navigate ships close to each other (<100 units)
4. Click on the other player's ship
5. Check console for battle initiation
6. Check home page for battle status & weapon cooldowns

## 🎯 Attack Range Comparison

| Action | Range | What Happens |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Attack** | 100 units | Battle starts, both ships stop |
| **Collect** | 125 units | Object collected, iron awarded |
| **Hover** | 20 pixels | Visual highlight on canvas |

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- ❌ Visual attack range indicator
- ❌ Confirmation dialog before attacking
- ❌ Attack cooldown display
- ❌ Target health bars on canvas
- ❌ Attack animation/effects
- ❌ Battle outcome notification popup

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **Same UX as Collection**: Players use familiar click-to-collect mechanics for attacking
2. **Auto-Range Detection**: System automatically determines if target is in range
3. **Interception Support**: Can click distant ships to start pursuit
4. **World Refresh**: Game automatically refreshes after battle start
5. **Console Logging**: Detailed logs help debug issues

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **One-Click Attack**: Just click on enemy ship
- ✅ **Smart Range Detection**: Automatically attacks or intercepts
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with logging
- ✅ **World Integration**: Works with existing game systems
- ✅ **Battle System Integration**: Connects to full battle mechanics
