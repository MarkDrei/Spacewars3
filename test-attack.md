# Attack Endpoint Testing

## Summary

The attack endpoint is hanging and not returning. The issue appears to be in the `initiateBattle()` function which calls `BattleRepo` methods that access the database.

## Problem Analysis

1. The attack API loads users from the database
2. It then calls `initiateBattle()` which:
   - Calls `getShipPosition()` - accesses database
   - Calls `setShipSpeed()` - accesses database  
   - Calls `BattleRepo.createBattle()` - accesses database
   - Calls `updateUserBattleState()` - accesses database

3. All these database calls use `await getDatabase()` which might be causing issues with multiple simultaneous initializations

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive logging to see exactly where it hangs
2. Ensure `getDatabase()` properly handles concurrent calls
3. Consider making battle operations use transactions to avoid conflicts

## Status

- Added logging to attack API (Step 1-4)
- Added logging to initiateBattle (starting, ship positions, battle stats, etc.)
- Need to test with fresh database
