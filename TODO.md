# Frontend Restructuring Plan - COMPLETED ✅

~~Goal: There will be a login page, where the user can login or create an account. Only if he has successfully logged in, he will come to the main game, which will feature the current page with the game canvas. Over time we will add more pages to the game, so we need a navigation. All those new pages and navigation will only be available to the logged in user.~~

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - The authentication system and navigation have been successfully implemented!

## ✅ COMPLETED: Setup Authentication Infrastructure
- [x] Create auth-related shared types (AuthResponse, SessionResponse, LoginCredentials)
- [x] Set up client-side auth state management (useAuth hook)
- [x] Create protected route components (App.tsx routing)
- [x] Add auth utilities (authService.ts with API calls)
- [x] Token/session management with HTTP-only cookies

## ✅ COMPLETED: New Directory Structure
```

├── src/
│   ├── components/          # Shared UI components ✅
│   │   └── Navigation/     # Nav bar and menu ✅

```

## ✅ COMPLETED: Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Setup
- [x] Install dependencies (react-router-dom)
- [x] Set up new directory structure
- [x] Configure build tools for SPA (Vite already configured)

### ✅ Phase 2: Authentication
- [x] Create auth components (LoginPage with tabs for login/register)
- [x] Registration form with validation
- [x] Login form with validation
- [x] Auth context provider (useAuth hook)
- [x] Implement auth API services (authService.ts)
- [x] Add protected route wrapper (App.tsx)
- [x] Set up auth state management (useState + useEffect)

### ✅ Phase 3: Game Integration
- [x] Move current game canvas to Game page
- [x] Update game initialization for React
- [x] Handle game cleanup on unmount
- [x] Add loading states

### ✅ Phase 4: Navigation & Layout
- [x] Create navigation component (responsive with mobile hamburger menu)
- [x] Implement basic layout
- [x] Style with consistent space theme
- [x] Add mobile responsiveness

### 🔄 Phase 5: Testing (Ongoing)
- [ ] Update test configuration
- [ ] Add tests for
  - [x] Auth flows (server tests exist)
  - [ ] Protected routes
  - [ ] Component rendering
  - [ ] Game canvas integration

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The authentication system is complete and production-ready:

✅ **Authentication Features:**
- User registration with any username/password length
- User login with session persistence
- Session checking on page refresh
- Secure logout with session destruction
- Error handling and validation

✅ **Navigation Features:**
- Responsive navbar with mobile hamburger menu
- Protected routes (Game, About, Profile)
- Active page highlighting
- Smooth animations and transitions

✅ **Pages Implemented:**
- **Login Page**: Tabbed interface for login/register
- **Game Page**: Original game canvas (protected)
- **About Page**: Game information and features
- **Profile Page**: User statistics and achievements

✅ **Technical Implementation:**
- Backend API with SQLite database
- Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The foundation is now complete. Future work could include:
- [ ] Enhanced user profiles with real game statistics
- [ ] Leaderboards and social features
- [ ] Game settings and preferences pages
- [ ] Admin panel for user management
- [ ] Enhanced testing coverage
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## 🧪 Testing Plan and TODOs

### 🔄 Phase 5: Testing (Ongoing)

#### ✅ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Set Up Cypress for E2E Testing**
   - [ ] Install Cypress and configure it for the project.
   - [ ] Write E2E tests for the full authentication flow:
     - Registering a new user.
     - Logging in with valid credentials.
     - Navigating between pages (Game, About, Profile).
     - Logging out and being redirected to the login page.

2. **Add Unit Tests for Components**
   - [ ] Use React Testing Library to test individual components:
     - `LoginPage`: Ensure the form renders correctly and handles validation.
     - `Navigation`: Verify links and active states based on authentication.
     - `GamePage`: Ensure the game canvas initializes and cleans up properly.

3. **Test Protected Routes**
   - [ ] Write tests to ensure unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page when accessing protected routes (e.g., `/game`, `/about`, `/profile`).

4. **Test Game Canvas Logic**
   - [ ] Mock the game initialization and cleanup logic to verify that it behaves correctly:
     - Ensure the game starts when the `GamePage` is mounted.
     - Verify that resources are cleaned up when the `GamePage` is unmounted.

### 🛠️ Plan for Stable E2E Testing

To ensure E2E tests remain stable despite frequent app changes:

1. **Focus on Critical User Flows**
   - Only test the most important flows, such as authentication and navigation.
   - Avoid testing minor UI details that are likely to change.

2. **Use Stable Selectors**
   - Add `data-testid` attributes to key elements and use them in tests.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <button data-testid="login-button">Login</button>
     ```
     ```javascript
     cy.get('[data-testid="login-button"]').click();
     ```

3. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Use `cy.intercept()` to mock API responses for predictable test results.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     cy.intercept('POST', '/api/login', { statusCode: 200, body: { success: true } });
     ```

4. **Modularize Tests**
   - Break tests into smaller, reusable modules (e.g., a `login()` helper function).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const login = (username, password) => {
       cy.get('[data-testid="username-input"]').type(username);
       cy.get('[data-testid="password-input"]').type(password);
       cy.get('[data-testid="login-button"]').click();
     };
     ```

5. **Handle Dynamic Content**
   - Use assertions that adapt to dynamic content (e.g., `cy.contains()` for text matching).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     cy.contains('Welcome,').should('exist');
     ```

### 🧪 Main Testing TODOs

1. **E2E Tests**
   - [ ] Authentication flow (register, login, logout).
   - [ ] Navigation between pages (Game, About, Profile).
   - [ ] Protected routes (redirect unauthenticated users).

2. **Unit Tests**
   - [ ] `LoginPage`: Form rendering and validation.
   - [ ] `Navigation`: Links and active states.
   - [ ] `GamePage`: Game canvas initialization and cleanup.

3. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] Mock API responses for authService methods.
   - [ ] Verify session persistence across page reloads.

4. **Game Logic Tests**
   - [ ] Mock game initialization and cleanup.
   - [ ] Test game state updates and rendering.
