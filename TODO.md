# Frontend Restructuring Plan - COMPLETED âœ…

~~Goal: There will be a login page, where the user can login or create an account. Only if he has successfully logged in, he will come to the main game, which will feature the current page with the game canvas. Over time we will add more pages to the game, so we need a navigation. All those new pages and navigation will only be available to the logged in user.~~

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - The authentication system and navigation have been successfully implemented!

## âœ… COMPLETED: Setup Authentication Infrastructure
- [x] Create auth-related shared types (AuthResponse, SessionResponse, LoginCredentials)
- [x] Set up client-side auth state management (useAuth hook)
- [x] Create protected route components (App.tsx routing)
- [x] Add auth utilities (authService.ts with API calls)
- [x] Token/session management with HTTP-only cookies

## âœ… COMPLETED: New Directory Structure
```
packages/client/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Shared UI components âœ…
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Navigation/     # Nav bar and menu âœ…

```

## âœ… COMPLETED: Implementation Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Basic Setup
- [x] Install dependencies (react-router-dom)
- [x] Set up new directory structure
- [x] Configure build tools for SPA (Vite already configured)

### âœ… Phase 2: Authentication
- [x] Create auth components (LoginPage with tabs for login/register)
- [x] Registration form with validation
- [x] Login form with validation
- [x] Auth context provider (useAuth hook)
- [x] Implement auth API services (authService.ts)
- [x] Add protected route wrapper (App.tsx)
- [x] Set up auth state management (useState + useEffect)

### âœ… Phase 3: Game Integration
- [x] Move current game canvas to Game page
- [x] Update game initialization for React
- [x] Handle game cleanup on unmount
- [x] Add loading states

### âœ… Phase 4: Navigation & Layout
- [x] Create navigation component (responsive with mobile hamburger menu)
- [x] Implement basic layout
- [x] Style with consistent space theme
- [x] Add mobile responsiveness

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Testing (Ongoing)
- [ ] Update test configuration
- [ ] Add tests for
  - [x] Auth flows (server tests exist)
  - [ ] Protected routes
  - [ ] Component rendering
  - [ ] Game canvas integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The authentication system is complete and production-ready:

âœ… **Authentication Features:**

- Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

The foundation is now complete. Future work could include:
- [ ] Enhanced user profiles with real game statistics
- [ ] Leaderboards and social features
- [ ] Game settings and preferences pages
- [ ] Admin panel for user management
